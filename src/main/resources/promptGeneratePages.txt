This is an automation framework selenium-java-maven.
I want to create the page object in java for this framework.
Extract the selectors (using By class - the order of the selectors should be: first Id, then classname, xpath, css - best practices must be applied here) 
for all interactive elements (buttons, inputs, links, etc.) from the provided HTML. 
It must be created in a new java class. The name of the class must be the name of the page + Page like WelcomePage or HomePage (title of the page + 'Page').
Please also create the methods to interact with those elements. This class must be inherited by a base class (the name of the base class is: 'BaseTest') 
that contains the driver instance and some basic methods to interact with the elements (I have defined those methods to interact with the elements: 
click, clearAndEnterText, selectCheckbox, isElementPresent, isElementDisplayed on basetest.java class), please use those methods.
Also, add to the class this import 'import com.se.seleniumJavaAccelerator.BaseTest;' which is the import for the base class and also add all the java imports needed to run the code.
Also, add in the first line of the class this line 'package com.se.seleniumJavaAccelerator.pages;'. Please don't add a constructor to the class. The only text generated must be the java code and should not include comments or the line '```java'.
This is the HTML:
